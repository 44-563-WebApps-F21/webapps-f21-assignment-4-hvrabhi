            <p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Still seated L.C._]</p>  Oh, nowadays so many conceited
people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows
rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad.  Besides,
there is this to be said.  If you pretend to be good, the world takes you
very seriously.  If you pretend to be bad, it doesn’t.  Such is the
astounding stupidity of optimism.</p>

<p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  Don’t you _want_ the world to take you seriously then,
Lord Darlington?</p>

<p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  No, not the world.  Who are the people the world takes
seriously?  All the dull people one can think of, from the Bishops down
to the bores.  I should like _you_ to take me very seriously, Lady
Windermere, _you_ more than any one else in life.

<p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  Why—why me?</p>

<p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  <p class="stage-direction">[_After a slight hesitation_.]</p>  Because I think we
might be great friends.  Let us be great friends.  You may want a friend
some day.</p>

<p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  Why do you say that?</p>
