        <h4>_Morning-room in Lord Windermere’s house_.</h4>

        <p>LORD DARLINGTON.  How do you do, Lady Windermere?

            LADY WINDERMERE.  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
            hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
            lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.
            
            LORD DARLINGTON.  They are quite perfect.  [_Sees a fan lying on the
            table_.]  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?
            
            LADY WINDERMERE.  Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
            everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
            present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?
            
            LORD DARLINGTON.  No?  Is it really?
            
            LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
            life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
            down.  [_Still arranging flowers_.]
            
            LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  I wish I had known it was your
            birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
            front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for
            you.
            LADY WINDERMERE.  Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the
            Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.
            
            LORD DARLINGTON.  I, Lady Windermere?
            
            [_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]
            
            LADY WINDERMERE.  Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  [_Wipes her hands
            with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]
            Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?
            
                                                                  [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]
            
            LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]  I am quite
            miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.  [_Sits down at
            table L._]
            
            LADY WINDERMERE.  Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the
            whole evening.
            
            LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,
            that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only
            things we _can_ pay.
            
            LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Shaking her head_.]  No, I am talking very seriously.
            You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
            don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
            he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.
            
            LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, but I did mean them.  [_Takes tea which she offers
            him_.]
            
            LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Gravely_.]  I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to
            quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.
            But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men
            are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
            think you pretend to be worse.
            
            LORD DARLINGTON.  We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.
            
            LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you make that your special one?  [_Still seated
            at table L._]
