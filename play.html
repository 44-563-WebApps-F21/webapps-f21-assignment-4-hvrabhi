        <p>
            <p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  How do you do, Lady Windermere?</P>

        <p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
            hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
            lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  They are quite perfect.  <p class="stage-direction">[_Sees a fan lying on the
            table_.]</p>  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
            everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
            present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?</P>
            
        <P class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  No?  Is it really?</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
            life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
            down.</p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Still arranging flowers_.]</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4> <P class="stage-direction"> [_Sitting down_.]</p>  I wish I had known it was your
            birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
            front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for
            you.</P>
        <p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the
            Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  I, Lady Windermere?</P>
            
            <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]</p>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  <p class="stage-direction">[_Wipes her hands
            with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]</p>
            Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?</P>
            
                                                                  <p>[_Exit_ PARKER _C._]</p>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]</P>  I am quite
            miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.</p>  <p>[_Sits down at
            table L._]</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the
            whole evening.</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  <P class="stage-direction">[_Smiling_.]</P>  Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,
            that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only
            things we _can_ pay.</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  <P class="stage-direction">[_Shaking her head_.]</P>  No, I am talking very seriously.
            You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
            don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
            he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  Ah, but I did mean them.</P>  <p>[_Takes tea which she offers
            him_.]</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  <P class="stage-direction">[_Gravely_.]</P>  I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to
            quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.
            But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men
            are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
            think you pretend to be worse.</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class="name lorddarlington">LORD DARLINGTON</h4>  We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.</P>
            
        <p class="speech"><h4 class= "name ladywindermare">LADY WINDERMERE</h4>  Why do you make that your special one?</P>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Still seated
